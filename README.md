# Overview
This project is a simple visualization of 4 subplots generated from a Kaggle dataset.

The dataset can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews/data

# Technologies
This is a Python script running 3.7, but will also run on 2.7.
The libaries that are used to work with the data are Pandas and Matplotlib for visuals.

# Subplots
The first subplot shows the top 5 rated countries with the highest average wine points.

The histogram displays the distribution of points which seems reasonable with the lower-bound at 80 out of 100.

The line chart tracks the price of the top rated countries. Austria seems to be best value with their wines are on avearage $10 less than the most expensive wines set by England, yet still being a member of the top 5 rated.

The last chart shows some wine origins that are decently rated (80/100) but should look at other options if you are hosting a gathering.
