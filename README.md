# Overview
This project is a simple visualization of 4 subplots generated from a Kaggle dataset.

The dataset can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews/data

The libaries that are used to work with the data are Pandas and Matplotlib for visuals.

I will post previous work or things I'm trying out here, time to time.
